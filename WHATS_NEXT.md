# 🎯 What's Next - Action Items

## ✅ What We Just Built (Tasks 1-4)

1. ✅ **API Documentation Portal** - Complete documentation page
2. ✅ **Top-up API Endpoints** - Automated wallet top-up system
3. ✅ **M-Pesa Integration** - STK Push for instant payments
4. ✅ **Sender Webhooks** - Real-time notifications to senders

**Status:** All code written and ready to use!

---

## 🚀 Your Next Steps (In Order)

### STEP 1: Run Migrations (5 minutes)

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

This creates the new database tables.

---

### STEP 2: View API Documentation (2 minutes)

Open in browser:
```
http://localhost:8000/api-documentation
```

This is what you'll share with your senders!

---

### STEP 3: Get M-Pesa Credentials (1-2 days)

**For Testing (Sandbox):**
1. Go to: https://developer.safaricom.co.ke
2. Create developer account
3. Create sandbox app
4. Get sandbox credentials:
   - Consumer Key
   - Consumer Secret  
   - Passkey
   - Use shortcode: 174379

**For Production:**
1. Contact Safaricom business support
2. Apply for M-Pesa Paybill/Till Number
3. Request Daraja API access
4. Get production credentials

---

### STEP 4: Configure M-Pesa (10 minutes)

Add to `.env`:

```env
MPESA_ENV=sandbox  # Change to 'production' when ready
MPESA_CONSUMER_KEY=your_key
MPESA_CONSUMER_SECRET=your_secret
MPESA_PASSKEY=your_passkey
MPESA_SHORTCODE=174379  # Your paybill number
```

---

### STEP 5: Test Top-up (5 minutes)

Test with manual mode first (no M-Pesa needed):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/1/wallet/topup \
  -H "X-API-Key: bae377bc-0282-4fc9-a2a1-e338b18da77a" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"amount\":1000,\"payment_method\":\"manual\",\"phone_number\":\"254712345678\"}"
```

Check if transaction was created.

---

### STEP 6: Setup Queue Worker (5 minutes)

For webhooks to work, run:

```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

Leave this running (use Supervisor in production).

---

### STEP 7: Test Webhooks (10 minutes)

1. Go to https://webhook.site
2. Copy your unique URL
3. Update database:

```sql
UPDATE clients 
SET 
  webhook_url = 'https://webhook.site/your-unique-id',
  webhook_secret = 'test_secret',
  webhook_events = '["balance.updated"]',
  webhook_active = 1
WHERE id = 1;
```

4. Test in tinker:
```bash
php artisan tinker

$client = \App\Models\Client::find(1);
$webhookService = app(\App\Services\WebhookService::class);
$webhookService->sendBalanceUpdated($client, 100, 200, 'TEST');
```

5. Check webhook.site - you should see the webhook!

---

### STEP 8: Test M-Pesa STK Push (15 minutes)

Once you have sandbox credentials:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/1/wallet/topup \
  -H "X-API-Key: bae377bc-0282-4fc9-a2a1-e338b18da77a" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"amount\":10,\"payment_method\":\"mpesa\",\"phone_number\":\"254708374149\"}"
```

**Sandbox test phone:** 254708374149  
**PIN:** Use any PIN in sandbox

Check if:
- Transaction created
- STK push sent (check logs)
- Balance updated after payment

```bash
php artisan route:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```
