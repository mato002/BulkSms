# Campaign Date Format Error Fix

## Problem
The error "Call to a member function format() on string" occurred when trying to view campaign details because the `created_at` field was being returned as a string instead of a Carbon/DateTime object.

## Root Cause
The CampaignController was using `DB::table()` queries instead of Eloquent models, which meant:
- Date fields were returned as raw strings from the database
- No automatic casting to Carbon instances
- No access to Carbon methods like `format()`, `diffForHumans()`, etc.

## Solution
Updated all methods in `CampaignController` to use the `Campaign` Eloquent model instead of raw database queries:

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Added Import
```php
use App\Models\Campaign;
```

#### 2. Updated All Methods to Use Eloquent:

**Before (Raw DB):**
```php
$campaign = DB::table('campaigns')
    ->where('client_id', $clientId)
    ->where('id', $id)
    ->first();
```

**After (Eloquent):**
```php
$campaign = Campaign::where('client_id', $clientId)
    ->where('id', $id)
    ->first();
```

#### 3. Methods Updated:
- âœ… `index()` - List campaigns
- âœ… `store()` - Create campaign
- âœ… `show()` - View campaign details
- âœ… `edit()` - Edit campaign form
- âœ… `update()` - Update campaign
- âœ… `destroy()` - Delete campaign
- âœ… `send()` - Send campaign

#### 4. Benefits of Eloquent Models:
- **Automatic Date Casting**: `created_at`, `updated_at`, `scheduled_at`, `sent_at` are automatically cast to Carbon instances
- **Array Casting**: `recipients` field is automatically cast from JSON to array
- **Type Safety**: Better type checking and IDE support
- **Model Events**: Access to model events and observers
- **Relationships**: Easy access to related models
- **Mass Assignment Protection**: Built-in fillable/guarded protection

#### 5. Date Casting in Campaign Model:
The Campaign model already has proper date casting configured:
```php
protected $casts = [
    'recipients' => 'array',
    'scheduled_at' => 'datetime',
    'sent_at' => 'datetime',
    'total_cost' => 'decimal:2'
];
```

## Result
- âœ… Campaign show page now works without errors
- âœ… Date formatting (`format('M d, Y')`, `diffForHumans()`) works correctly
- âœ… All date fields display properly
- âœ… Better performance and maintainability
- âœ… Consistent with Laravel best practices

## Files Modified:
- `app/Http/Controllers/CampaignController.php` - Updated all methods to use Eloquent

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Navigate to any campaign detail page (`/campaigns/{id}`)
2. Verify that created_at and other date fields display correctly
3. Check that no "Call to a member function format() on string" errors occur
4. Test all campaign operations (create, edit, delete, send)

The error should now be completely resolved! ðŸŽ‰
