Subject: Request to Disable Sender ID Filter for Account

Dear Onfon Media Support,

I am writing to request that the sender ID filter/whitelist be disabled for our account.

Account Details:
- Client ID: e27847c1-a9fe-4eef-b60d-ddb291b175ab
- API Key: VKft5j+GOeSXYSlk+sADT/nx5UMVpcmengSPk9Ou4Ak=

Issue:
We are experiencing errors when trying to send SMS with sender IDs that are not in the approved whitelist:
"Onfon MessageErrorCode 401: Value filter failed for user [e27847c1-a9fe-4eef-b60d-ddb291b175ab] (source_address filter mismatch)."

Business Model:
We operate a multi-tenant SMS platform where:
- We pay Onfon for SMS gateway services
- Our clients pay us for SMS services
- Each client has their own sender ID (e.g., "MATECHTE", "FORTRESS", etc.)

Request:
Since we are the paying customer managing multiple businesses, we need the ability to use ANY sender ID from our account without restrictions. Please disable the sender ID filter/whitelist for our account so we can use any sender ID our clients require.

This will allow us to:
- Onboard new clients without waiting for sender ID approval
- Use any sender ID our clients are registered with
- Scale our business more efficiently

Please let us know if you need any additional information or documentation.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
