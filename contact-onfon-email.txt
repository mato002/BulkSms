Subject: Request to Disable Sender ID Filter or Register "MATECHTE" Sender ID

Dear Onfon Media Support Team,

I am writing regarding our Onfon Media account. We are experiencing an issue with sender ID restrictions that is affecting our business operations.

ACCOUNT DETAILS:
- Client ID: e27847c1-a9fe-4eef-b60d-ddb291b175ab
- API Key: VKft5j+GOeSXYSlk+sADT/nx5UMVpcmengSPk9Ou4Ak=
- Access Key Header: 8oj1kheKHtCX6RiiOOI1sNS9Ir88CXnB

ISSUE:
We are receiving the following error when attempting to send SMS with sender ID "MATECHTE":
"Onfon MessageErrorCode 401: Value filter failed for user [e27847c1-a9fe-4eef-b60d-ddb291b175ab] (source_address filter mismatch)."

BUSINESS MODEL:
We operate a multi-tenant SMS platform (BulkSMS CRM) where:
- We pay Onfon Media for SMS gateway services
- Our clients pay us for SMS services
- Each client has their own registered sender ID (e.g., "MATECHTE", "FORTRESS", "PRADY_TECH", etc.)

REQUEST:
We have two requests, in order of preference:

1. PRIMARY REQUEST: Disable the sender ID filter/whitelist for our account
   Since we are the paying customer managing multiple businesses, we need the ability to use ANY sender ID from our account without restrictions. This will allow us to:
   - Onboard new clients immediately without waiting for sender ID approval
   - Use any sender ID our clients are registered with
   - Scale our business more efficiently

2. ALTERNATIVE REQUEST: Register "MATECHTE" sender ID
   If disabling the filter is not possible, please register the sender ID "MATECHTE" for our account. We can provide any required documentation (business registration, Letter of Authorization, etc.).

ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS:
- Is there a way to register multiple sender IDs in bulk?
- Do you offer an enterprise/premium plan that allows unrestricted sender IDs?
- Is there an API endpoint to register sender IDs programmatically?

IMPACT:
This issue is currently blocking our ability to serve one of our clients (Matech Technologies) and may affect future client onboarding.

We appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and are available to provide any additional information or documentation you may require.

Thank you for your assistance.
