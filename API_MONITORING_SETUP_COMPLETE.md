# üîç API Request Monitoring System - Complete Setup

## ‚úÖ What Was Installed

I've set up a comprehensive API request monitoring system that tracks every API call made to your platform.

---

## üìä Features

### 1. **Automatic Request Logging**
   - Every API request is automatically logged
   - Tracks success and failures
   - Measures response times
   - Records IP addresses and user agents
   - Captures request and response data

### 2. **Security Features**
   - API keys are masked in logs
   - Sensitive data (passwords) are automatically redacted
   - Headers are sanitized before storage

### 3. **Real-time Monitoring Dashboard**
   - View all API requests in real-time
   - Filter by client, status, endpoint, method, date
   - Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
   - Color-coded for success/failure

### 4. **Statistics & Analytics**
   - Total requests today/week/month
   - Success rate calculations
   - Average response time tracking
   - Requests by endpoint
   - Hourly activity charts

## üöÄ How to Access

### View API Monitor Dashboard

```
URL: https://crm.pradytecai.com/api-monitor
```

**Login to your account and navigate to:**
- Dashboard ‚Üí Click "API Monitor" in the sidebar
- Or directly visit: `/api-monitor`

---

## üìã What Gets Logged

For each API request, the system logs:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Client** | Which organization made the request |
| **Endpoint** | API endpoint called (e.g., `/api/1/messages/send`) |
| **Method** | HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) |
| **IP Address** | Client's IP address |
| **Request Headers** | All HTTP headers (API keys masked) |
| **Request Body** | JSON request payload (passwords masked) |
| **Response Status** | HTTP status code (200, 401, 500, etc.) |
| **Response Body** | API response data |
| **Response Time** | How long the request took (in milliseconds) |
| **Success/Failure** | Whether the request succeeded |
| **Error Message** | Any error messages |
| **Timestamp** | When the request was made |

---

## üìà Dashboard Features

### Statistics Cards

At the top of the dashboard you'll see:

1. **Today's Requests** - Total API calls today
2. **Successful** - Successful requests with success rate %
3. **Failed** - Failed requests with failure rate %
4. **Avg Response Time** - Average API response time in milliseconds

### Filters

Filter logs by:
- **Client** - See requests from specific organizations
- **Status** - Success or Failed only
- **Method** - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- **Date Range** - From/To dates
- **Endpoint** - Search by API endpoint

### Request List

View all requests with:
- Time (with "X minutes ago" format)
- Client name and ID
- HTTP method (color-coded badges)
- Endpoint path
- IP address
- Status code (success/failure badge)
- Response time (green < 1s, yellow < 3s, red > 3s)
- View Details button

### Request Details Page

Click "View Details" on any request to see:
- Complete request overview
- Full request headers
- Complete request body
- Full response body
- User agent information
- Error details (if failed)

## üîî Monitoring Tips

### Check for Issues

**High Failure Rate?**
- Filter by `Status: Failed`
- Look for patterns in the errors
- Check which client is having issues
- Review error messages

**Slow Response Times?**
- Sort by response time
- Look for consistently slow endpoints
- Check if specific clients are affected
- Consider optimization

**Unusual Activity?**
- Check IP addresses for suspicious requests
- Look for unusual request patterns
- Monitor failed authentication attempts

---

## üìä Example Queries

### See All Failed Requests Today
```
Navigate to: /api-monitor
Select: Status = Failed
```

### Monitor Prady Tech's API Usage
```
Navigate to: /api-monitor
Select: Client = Prady Technologies
```

### Check Slow Requests
```
Look for requests with red response time badges (> 3000ms)
```

### View All SMS Send Requests
```
Navigate to: /api-monitor
Enter in search: messages/send
```

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Table

All logs are stored in the `api_logs` table:

```sql
-- View recent API requests
SELECT * FROM api_logs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;

-- Count requests by client today
SELECT client_id, COUNT(*) as total 
FROM api_logs 
WHERE DATE(created_at) = CURDATE() 
GROUP BY client_id;

-- Average response time per endpoint
SELECT endpoint, AVG(response_time_ms) as avg_time 
FROM api_logs 
GROUP BY endpoint 
ORDER BY avg_time DESC;

-- Failed requests in last hour
SELECT * FROM api_logs 
WHERE success = 0 
AND created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR);
```

---

## üßπ Cleanup (Optional)

To prevent the database from growing too large:

### Automatic Cleanup (Recommended)

Add this to your `app/Console/Kernel.php` schedule:

```php
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    // Delete API logs older than 30 days
    $schedule->call(function () {
        \App\Models\ApiLog::where('created_at', '<', now()->subDays(30))->delete();
    })->daily();
}
```

### Manual Cleanup

Navigate to `/api-monitor` and use the cleanup feature (if added), or run:

```sql
DELETE FROM api_logs WHERE created_at < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY);
```

---

## üì± Real-Time Monitoring

The dashboard auto-refreshes every 30 seconds to show the latest requests.

### API Endpoints for Integration

If you want to build custom dashboards or alerts:

**Get Recent Activity:**
```
GET /api-monitor-activity
Returns last 20 API requests as JSON
```

**Get Statistics:**
```
GET /api-monitor-stats?period=week&client_id=1
Returns statistics for specific period and client
```

---

## üîß Configuration

### Disable Logging (if needed)

If you need to temporarily disable logging, edit `app/Http/Middleware/ApiAuth.php` and comment out the logging calls.

### Adjust Auto-refresh

Edit `resources/views/api-monitor/index.blade.php`:

```javascript
// Change from 30000 (30 seconds) to desired interval
setInterval(refreshData, 60000); // 60 seconds
```
