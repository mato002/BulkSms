# üß™ Test Your API Monitoring System

## Quick Test Guide

### Step 1: Make a Test API Request

**Option A: Using cURL (Command Line)**
```bash
curl -X POST https://crm.pradytecai.com/api/1/messages/send \
  -H "X-API-Key: bae377bc-0282-4fc9-a2a1-e338b18da77a" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "channel": "sms",
    "recipient": "254712345678",
    "body": "Test message for monitoring",
    "sender": "PRADY_TECH",
    "client_id": 1
  }'
```

**Option B: Test with Invalid API Key (to see failure logging)**
```bash
curl -X POST https://crm.pradytecai.com/api/1/messages/send \
  -H "X-API-Key: invalid_key_test_123" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "channel": "sms",
    "recipient": "254712345678",
    "body": "This should fail",
    "sender": "PRADY_TECH",
    "client_id": 1
  }'
```

**Option C: Test Balance Check**
```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: bae377bc-0282-4fc9-a2a1-e338b18da77a" \
  https://crm.pradytecai.com/api/1/client/balance
```

### Step 2: View the Logs

1. **Login to your dashboard:**
   ```
   https://crm.pradytecai.com/login
   ```

2. **Navigate to API Monitor:**
   - Look at the left sidebar
   - Under "Developer" section
   - Click on "API Monitor"
   
   Or go directly to:
   ```
   https://crm.pradytecai.com/api-monitor
   ```

3. **You should see:**
   - Your test request(s) in the table
   - Green badge for successful requests
   - Red badge for failed requests
   - Response time in milliseconds
   - IP address of the request
   - Timestamp

---

### Step 3: View Request Details

1. Click the **eye icon** (üëÅÔ∏è) on any request
2. You'll see:
   - Complete request headers
   - Request body (JSON)
   - Response body (JSON)
   - Response time
   - Error message (if failed)
   - IP and User Agent

---

### Step 4: Test Filters

**Filter by Status:**
1. Select "Status: Failed" from dropdown
2. Click search
3. Should see only failed requests

**Filter by Client:**
1. Select "Prady Technologies" from Client dropdown
2. Click search
3. Should see only Prady Tech requests

**Filter by Date:**
1. Enter today's date in "From Date"
2. Click search
3. Should see only today's requests

---

## What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Successful Request
- Green status badge (200)
- Success = ‚úÖ True
- Response time shown in green (if < 1s)
- Response body contains success data

### ‚ùå Failed Request
- Red status badge (401, 500, etc.)
- Success = ‚ùå False
- Error message displayed
- Row highlighted in red

---

## Statistics to Check

At the top of the dashboard, verify:

1. **Today's Requests** - Should show your test requests count
2. **Successful** - Should show successful test count with % rate
3. **Failed** - Should show failed test count with % rate
4. **Avg Response Time** - Should show average in milliseconds

---

## Sidebar Badge

Look at the sidebar:
- "API Monitor" should show a badge with today's request count
- Badge is GREEN if all requests successful
- Badge is RED if any requests failed

---

## Real-Time Updates

The dashboard auto-refreshes every 30 seconds, so:
1. Leave the dashboard open
2. Make a new API request from another window
3. Wait up to 30 seconds
4. See the new request appear automatically

Or click the **Refresh button** for immediate update.

---

## Check Laravel Logs

Your API requests are also logged to Laravel logs:

```bash
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

You should see entries like:
```
[2025-10-19 15:30:45] local.INFO: API Request {"client":"Prady Technologies","endpoint":"api/1/messages/send","method":"POST","ip":"127.0.0.1","response_time":"125.50ms"}
```

---

## Database Verification

Check that logs are being stored:

```sql
-- View recent API logs
SELECT 
    id,
    client_id,
    endpoint,
    method,
    response_status,
    success,
    response_time_ms,
    created_at
FROM api_logs 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

---

## Test Checklist

- [ ] Made a successful API request
- [ ] Made a failed API request (invalid API key)
- [ ] Viewed API Monitor dashboard
- [ ] Saw requests in the table
- [ ] Clicked "View Details" on a request
- [ ] Filtered by status (success/failed)
- [ ] Filtered by client
- [ ] Checked statistics cards at top
- [ ] Saw sidebar badge with count
- [ ] Verified request in database

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No requests showing"

**Check:**
1. Did the migration run successfully?
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate:status
   ```
2. Is the API request actually reaching your server?
3. Check Laravel logs for errors
4. Verify routes are registered:
   ```bash
   php artisan route:list | grep api-monitor
   ```

### "Error viewing dashboard"

**Check:**
1. ApiLog model exists: `app/Models/ApiLog.php`
2. Migration created table: Check database for `api_logs` table
3. Routes are registered: Check `routes/web.php`

### "Requests not being logged"

**Check:**
1. API middleware is being used on API routes
2. Check `app/Http/Middleware/ApiAuth.php` for logging code
3. Look for exceptions in Laravel logs

---

## Expected Results

**Dashboard:**
- ‚úÖ 3+ requests in the table

## Advanced Tests

### Test Performance Tracking

Make 10 quick requests:
```bash
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -H "X-API-Key: bae377bc-0282-4fc9-a2a1-e338b18da77a" \
    https://crm.pradytecai.com/api/1/client/balance
  sleep 1
done
```

Then check:
- Average response time
- Min/Max response times
- Performance trends

### Test Different Endpoints

```bash
# Test SMS history
curl -H "X-API-Key: bae377bc-0282-4fc9-a2a1-e338b18da77a" \
  "https://crm.pradytecai.com/api/1/sms/history?page=1"

# Test SMS statistics
curl -H "X-API-Key: bae377bc-0282-4fc9-a2a1-e338b18da77a" \
  "https://crm.pradytecai.com/api/1/sms/statistics?period=week"
```

Then filter by endpoint to see each one.
