## How Password Reset Works

1. **User clicks "Forgot Password?" on login page**
   - Redirects to `/forgot-password`

2. **User enters their email address**
   - System validates email exists in database
   - Sends password reset link to email
   - Shows success message

3. **User clicks link in email**
   - Opens reset password page with unique token
   - Token is valid for 60 minutes (default)

4. **User enters new password**
   - Must confirm password
   - Must meet minimum requirements (8+ characters)
   - Token is validated

5. **Success!**
   - Password is updated
   - User is redirected to login page
   - Can now login with new password

## Testing the System

### To test locally (if email is not configured):

1. Visit: `http://localhost/bulk-sms-laravel/public/login`
2. Click "Forgot Password?"
3. Enter a valid email from your users table

### Required: Email Configuration

Add to your `.env` file:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

For Gmail:
- Use an App Password (not your regular password)
- Go to: Google Account → Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords

## Database Requirements

The system uses the `password_reset_tokens` table which should already exist from migrations.

If needed, run:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```
