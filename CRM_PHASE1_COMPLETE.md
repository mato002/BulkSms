## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Webhook Flow (Inbound)
```
Customer sends SMS → Onfon receives → Webhook to /api/webhooks/onfon/inbound
→ Find/create contact → Find/create conversation → Save message (direction=inbound)
→ Update unread counters → Update conversation metadata
```

### Reply Flow
```
Agent types reply → Submit form → InboxController@reply
→ Create OutboundMessage → MessageDispatcher → OnfonSmsSender → Onfon API
→ Save to DB (direction=outbound) → Update conversation → Redirect to chat
```

### Conversation Threading
- Unique per (client_id, contact_id, channel)
- Multiple channels = multiple conversations with same contact
- Messages linked via conversation_id foreign key
- Ordered by created_at within conversation

## 📊 What This Achieves

### Before (Broadcast System):
- ❌ One-way sending only
- ❌ No customer replies

- ❌ No context when messaging same person twice

### After (Full CRM):
- ✅ Two-way communication
- ✅ Receive and display customer replies
- ✅ Full conversation history per contact
- ✅ Context preserved across interactions
- ✅ Inbox with unread management
- ✅ Quick reply from chat interface
- ✅ Team-ready (assignment field exists)
