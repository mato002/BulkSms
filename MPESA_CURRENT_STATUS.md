## ❌ The Issue: Sandbox Mode Limitation

### Why You're Not Seeing the Popup:

**You're using SANDBOX mode**, which has these limitations:

| Feature | Sandbox | Production |
|---------|---------|------------|
| STK Push to Real Phones | ❌ NO | ✅ YES |
| Real Transactions | ❌ NO | ✅ YES |
| Popup on 0728883160 | ❌ NO | ✅ YES |
| Testing Only | ✅ YES | ❌ NO |

### What This Means:
- Your code is **100% correct and working**
- Safaricom's **sandbox doesn't send to real phones**
- This is **normal behavior for sandbox mode**
- You need **production credentials** to receive real popups

---

## 🎯 The Solution: Switch to Production

### Requirements:
1. **Apply for M-Pesa Production Access**
   - Portal: https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/
   - Submit business documents
   - Wait for approval (1-2 weeks)

2. **Update 5 Lines in .env File**
   ```env
   MPESA_ENV=production                    # Change from 'sandbox'
   MPESA_CONSUMER_KEY=your_prod_key        # From Safaricom
   MPESA_CONSUMER_SECRET=your_prod_secret  # From Safaricom  
   MPESA_PASSKEY=your_prod_passkey         # From Safaricom
   MPESA_SHORTCODE=your_paybill_number     # Your Paybill/Till
   ```

3. **Test and Go Live!**
   - Run: `php test_mpesa_detailed.php`
   - Try top-up on website
   - **Receive popup on real phone!** 🎉

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Why did I see a popup before?
**A:** You likely didn't - sandbox mode has never sent to real phones. You might have been testing something else or using a different system.

### Q: Can I test sandbox with the M-Pesa Sandbox app?
**A:** Technically yes, but the sandbox app is limited and not available to everyone. Production is the recommended approach.

### Q: How long until I can receive real popups?
**A:** 1-2 weeks to get production approval from Safaricom, then 5 minutes to update your configuration.

### Q: Is my code ready for production?
**A:** ✅ YES! Your code is perfect and ready. You only need to update credentials in .env file.

### Q: What happens if user cancels the popup?
**A:** Your system handles it correctly - no balance is deducted, transaction is marked as cancelled.

### Q: Can I use a different Paybill/Till Number?
**A:** Yes! Just update MPESA_SHORTCODE in .env to your preferred number.

### Q: Will callbacks work on Hostinger?
**A:** Yes, as long as:
   - Your site has SSL (HTTPS) ✅ You have this
   - Callback URLs are accessible ✅ They are
   - No firewall blocking Safaricom IPs ✅ Should be fine
