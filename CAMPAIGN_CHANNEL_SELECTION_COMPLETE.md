## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Changes
```sql
-- Added columns to campaigns table
ALTER TABLE campaigns 
ADD COLUMN channel VARCHAR(191) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'sms' AFTER sender_id,
ADD COLUMN template_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL AFTER channel;

-- Added foreign key
ALTER TABLE campaigns 
ADD CONSTRAINT campaigns_template_id_foreign 
FOREIGN KEY (template_id) REFERENCES templates(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

### Validation Rules

**Store Campaign**:
```php
'channel' => 'required|in:sms,whatsapp',
'sender_id' => 'nullable|string|max:255',  // Changed from required
'template_id' => 'nullable|exists:templates,id',
```

**Update Campaign**:
```php
'channel' => 'required|in:sms,whatsapp',
'sender_id' => 'nullable|string|max:255',
'template_id' => 'nullable|exists:templates,id',
```

### Message Dispatching
```php
$outbound = new OutboundMessage(
    clientId: $clientId,
    channel: $campaign->channel ?? 'sms',  // Uses campaign's channel
    recipient: $recipient,
    sender: $campaign->sender_id,
    body: $campaign->message,
    templateId: $campaign->template_id ?? null  // Passes template if selected
);
```
