## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Monitor on Second Screen
Keep `/api-monitor` open on a second monitor to watch API activity in real-time.

### Tip 2: Check After Client Reports Issues
When a client says "it's not working", check the monitor FIRST before asking questions.

### Tip 3: Watch the Sidebar Badge
The badge shows request count and turns RED if there are failures today.

### Tip 4: Use Filters for Specific Clients
Save time by filtering to specific clients when debugging their issues.

### Tip 5: Check Response Times
Slow API (> 1s) means you might need to optimize or scale.
